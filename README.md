## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows the **Medallion Architecture** pattern with **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**, ensuring scalability, data quality, and analytical efficiency.

### 🔹 Bronze Layer

* Stores raw data **as-is** from source systems
* Data ingested from **CSV files** into **SQL Server**
* Acts as a landing zone for source data

### 🔹 Silver Layer

* Data **cleansing, standardization, and normalization**
* Resolves data quality issues
* Prepares refined data for analytical use

### 🔹 Gold Layer

* Contains **business-ready data**
* Modeled using a **Star Schema**
* Optimized for reporting and analytics
